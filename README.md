During this project I had to look up a few different youtube tutorials to wrap my head around the logic which was needed to 
regenerate the canvas. Also I had to figure out e.target.matches, because with other loops I only managed to change the first 
block in the canvas. After this I ran in a little bit of trouble to keep the same colour of the pen after the clear button was 
pressed. The las real test was to add the slider. It took me a while to figure out how to make the slider connect to the canvas
since I wasn't familiar with the change event. In a later stadium I might wanna write more code into functions since I still 
have some repeated code left.
